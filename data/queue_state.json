Thought I was done...\n\n[Verse 1] (Beat drops hard, fast rap flow) Yeah, I've been through the fire, walked on the coals Fought with the demons tryin' to swallow me whole Every scar is a story, every cut is a map They wrote me off, said I'd collapse, (ha) But they don't know the steel that's inside my bones Built this kingdom all alone, sittin' on a broken throne This ain't for the fame, this ain't for the gold This is for the ones they told would never get old!\n\n[Pre-Chorus] (Music swells, strings come in, drums build) They can push me down, down to the ground But I LOVE the sound... of the comeback! (Shouted) Can you hear it now?!\n\n[Chorus] (Full instrumentation: Guitars, Drums, Strings, Gang Vocals) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!\n\n[Verse 2] (Fast rap flow returns, guitar riff is prominent) So take your shot, yeah, give it your best Put my armor to the test, I got no time for rest While you were talkin', I was trainin' in the dark Turned all my pain into an arc, a work of art I'm the 1 in 100, the survivor, the chief The anchor of my own belief, the end of all my grief This is the new me, this is the final form The quiet center... of the storm!\n\n[Pre-Chorus] (Music swells, strings come in, drums build) They can push me down, down to the ground But I LOVE the sound... of the comeback! (Shouted) Can you hear it now?!\n\n[Chorus] (Full instrumentation: Guitars, Drums, Strings, Gang Vocals) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!\n\n[Bridge] (Music drops to just Piano and Cinematic Strings) (Melodic singing, emotional) They tried to bury me... They didn't know... I was a seed... (Drums start to build... faster... faster...) (Shouted) I WAS A SEED! WATCH ME GROW!\n\n[Chorus] (Maximum energy, double-time drums, guitars shredding) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!\n\n[Outro] (Music swells to a final crash) (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Shouted) UNBREAKABLE! (Sound of a final guitar chord and thunderclap)",

(Male): I won't let go!\n\n[Guitar Solo] (Epic, melodic, emotional guitar solo over heavy drums and strings)\n\n[Chorus: Duet, Anthemic] (Biggest chorus, ad-libs) Let's let the echoes fade tonight Run from the shadow, find the light I won't give up, I won't give in This is where our new story begins We've said our last goodbyes Set fire to the old lies This time, I'm not letting go This time, I'm not letting go\n\n[Outro: Duet] (Fading out with piano and strings) (Female): Just let the echoes go... (Male): I'm not letting go... (Duet): This time... we won't let go. (Piano fades to nothing)",
