<TITLE>lilies in the pond.</TITLE>

<LYRICS>
she said, darling how do i look tonight
through fogged glass lenses,
with a sigh, like doom waltzing into my life
you never have to try

     we go hand in hand
     we're both skeletons
     watch the lilies in the pond
     what a fine inheritance

          a bit of blood on the table
          bit of blood on your dress
          we should leave if we're able
          or we can drink to excess

it's a gold chain against your skin
it's all the things we'll never do or say again
it's a fire's roar of discontent
it's a start to know your heart's every dark intent

     we go hand in hand
     we're both skeletons
     watch the lilies in the pond
     what a fine inheritance

          a bit of blood on the table
          bit of blood on your dress
          we should leave if we're able
          or we can drink to excess

wear your true face
     please just wear your true face
through desperate straits
     can you ever know grace
wear your true face
     please just wear your true face
through desperate straits
     can you ever know grace

a bit of blood on the table
bit of blood on your dress
we should leave if we're able
or we can drink to excess

      i know your eyes
      seen your past lives
      but you don't know mine
      you don't know mine

i know your eyes
seen your past lives
but you don't know mine
well, you know, that's fine
