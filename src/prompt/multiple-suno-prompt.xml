<LYRICS>
[Verse 1]
The needle drops, a soft hiss found
Outside the glass, the snow floats down
The tenor sax breathes a silver theme
Lost in a quiet, holiday dream
The streetlights wear a misty halo

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Verse 2]
Your shadow sways against the wall
I hear the distant church bells call
The piano chords hang in the air
A silent wish, a whispered prayer
Each note a ghost of Christmases past

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Bridge]
Time is a record, spinning slow
Every refrain, a soft afterglow
The world outside can rush and race
We've found our rhythm in this place

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Outro]
Just the brushes on the snare
And snowflakes melting in your hair
Fading...

<TITLE>UNBREAKABLE</TITLE>

<LYRICS>
[Intro] (Sound of rain and a distant thunderclap) (Dark Piano Melody begins) (Whispered): They thought I was broken... Thought I was done...

[Verse 1] (Beat drops hard, fast rap flow) Yeah, I've been through the fire, walked on the coals Fought with the demons tryin' to swallow me whole Every scar is a story, every cut is a map They wrote me off, said I'd collapse, (ha) But they don't know the steel that's inside my bones Built this kingdom all alone, sittin' on a broken throne This ain't for the fame, this ain't for the gold This is for the ones they told would never get old!

[Pre-Chorus] (Music swells, strings come in, drums build) They can push me down, down to the ground But I LOVE the sound... of the comeback! (Shouted) Can you hear it now?!

[Chorus] (Full instrumentation: Guitars, Drums, Strings, Gang Vocals) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!

[Verse 2] (Fast rap flow returns, guitar riff is prominent) So take your shot, yeah, give it your best Put my armor to the test, I got no time for rest While you were talkin', I was trainin' in the dark Turned all my pain into an arc, a work of art I'm the 1 in 100, the survivor, the chief The anchor of my own belief, the end of all my grief This is the new me, this is the final form The quiet center... of the storm!

[Pre-Chorus] (Music swells, strings come in, drums build) They can push me down, down to the ground But I LOVE the sound... of the comeback! (Shouted) Can you hear it now?!

[Chorus] (Full instrumentation: Guitars, Drums, Strings, Gang Vocals) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!

[Bridge] (Music drops to just Piano and Cinematic Strings) (Melodic singing, emotional) They tried to bury me... They didn't know... I was a seed... (Drums start to build... faster... faster...) (Shouted) I WAS A SEED! WATCH ME GROW!

[Chorus] (Maximum energy, double-time drums, guitars shredding) (Shouted) I AM UNBREAKABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! My spirit's a FIRE, UNQUENCHABLE! (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! I'll rise from the ashes, I'm more than this flesh Yeah, you can't kill a legend, I'm coming up fresh! I AM UNBREAKABLE!

[Outro] (Music swells to a final crash) (Chant) Whoa-oh-oh-oh! (Shouted) UNBREAKABLE! (Sound of a final guitar chord and thunderclap)

<TITLE>Echoes Fade</TITLE>

<LYRICS>
[Piano Intro] (Soft, atmospheric piano and strings)

[Verse 1: Female Vocals] (Soft, reflective) I built these walls up, stone by stone Learned how to make it on my own The ghosts of goodbye, they haunt this room Afraid to let a new flower bloom

[Verse 2: Male Vocals] (Matching energy, drums enter softly) I wear the armor, hide the scars Wished on a million broken stars This fragile trust, it's hard to find When you've been the one left behind

[Pre-Chorus: Duet] (Harmonizing, building tension) (Female): But I see the truth inside your eyes (Male): We're tired of living in disguise (Duet): What if we let the past ignite?

[Chorus: Duet, Anthemic] (Drums kick in, strings swell, full power) Let's let the echoes fade tonight Run from the shadow, find the light I won't give up, I won't give in This is where our new story begins We've said our last goodbyes Set fire to the old lies This time, I'm not letting go This time, I'm not letting go

[Verse 3: Female Vocals] (Stronger, more confident) You trace the lines upon my hand You're the one who understands The wreckage of what came before You're standing at the open door

[Pre-Chorus: Duet] (Harmonizing, building again) (Female): I see the future in your eyes (Male): No more excuses, no more lies (Duet): It's time to let our new life rise

[Chorus: Duet, Anthemic] (Full power, soaring vocals) Let's let the echoes fade tonight Run from the shadow, find the light I won't give up, I won't give in This is where our new story begins We've said our last goodbyes Set fire to the old lies This time, I'm not letting go This time, I'm not letting go

[Bridge: Duet] (Music drops slightly, then builds massively) (Female): We can't erase all the pain (Male): But we can learn to live again (Duet): Through all the thunder, all the rain (Female): I won't let go! (Male): I won't let go!

[Guitar Solo] (Epic, melodic, emotional guitar solo over heavy drums and strings)

[Chorus: Duet, Anthemic] (Biggest chorus, ad-libs) Let's let the echoes fade tonight Run from the shadow, find the light I won't give up, I won't give in This is where our new story begins We've said our last goodbyes Set fire to the old lies This time, I'm not letting go This time, I'm not letting go

[Outro: Duet] (Fading out with piano and strings) (Female): Just let the echoes go... (Male): I'm not letting go... (Duet): This time... we won't let go. (Piano fades to nothing)

<LYRICS>
[Verse 1]
The needle drops, a soft hiss found
Outside the glass, the snow floats down
The tenor sax breathes a silver theme
Lost in a quiet, holiday dream
The streetlights wear a misty halo

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Verse 2]
Your shadow sways against the wall
I hear the distant church bells call
The piano chords hang in the air
A silent wish, a whispered prayer
Each note a ghost of Christmases past

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Bridge]
Time is a record, spinning slow
Every refrain, a soft afterglow
The world outside can rush and race
We've found our rhythm in this place

[Chorus]
This city sleeps in shades of blue
A cool jazz Christmas, me and you

[Outro]
Just the brushes on the snare
And snowflakes melting in your hair
Fading...
